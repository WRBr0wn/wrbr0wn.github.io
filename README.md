## 0. Project Overview
This repository hosts the personal portfolio and digital curriculum vitae for Wyatt Brown. The architecture is designed as a static, responsive web application utilizing a "Bento-grid" layout engine to organize core competencies, technical projects, and creative works into a modular interface.

The system serves two primary functions:
1.  **Professional Dossier:** Aggregating data science projects, resume highlights, and technical skills.
2.  **Creative Gallery:** Hosting the "Drawn @ Dusk" digital art collection.

## I. Technical Architecture

The frontend is built on a lightweight, dependency-minimal stack optimized for performance and semantic clarity.

| Component | Technology | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure** | HTML5 | Semantic tagging (Main, Section, Nav) |
| **Styling** | CSS3 | Custom `modern.css` with Bento-grid layout logic |
| **Interaction** | JavaScript | `lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js` for gallery modals |
| **Hosting** | GitHub Pages | Static deployment pipeline |
| **Fonts** | Google Fonts | Inter (Weights: 300, 400, 600, 800) |

## II. Portfolio Modules

### A. Core Competencies (Data Science)
The primary interface (`index.html`) highlights the following technical proficiencies:
* **Languages:** Python, R, SQL, Java, Julia/JuMP.
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, Git.
* **Focus Areas:** Machine Learning Optimization, Statistical Analysis.

### B. Featured Projects
The portfolio routes traffic to specific technical repositories:
1.  **Vending Machine Sales Optimization:** Utilizes "Predict-then-Optimize" modeling in Python & Julia to achieve a 51% cost reduction.
2.  **Graphical Particle Simulator:** A containerized physics engine built with Java & Docker, featuring API state persistence.

### C. Creative Sub-System: "Drawn @ Dusk"
A dedicated sub-module (`DrawnAtDusk.html`) serves as a digital gallery.
* **Functionality:** Implements a Lightbox viewer for high-resolution inspection of physical media (Acrylic, Scratchboard).
* **Categorization:** Works are tagged by series (e.g., "Japanese Series," "Scratchboard Series") and origin ("Repaint" vs. "Original").
